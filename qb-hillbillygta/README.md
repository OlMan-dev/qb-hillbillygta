# Hill Billy GTA - Free Car Theft and Dismantling Job

A free and immersive car theft script for FiveM designed for **QBcore** servers.

In this script, players take on a car heist job for a shady gas and repair station in **Sandy Shores**, which sources parts through less-than-legal means. Don't worry, though—Billy Joe always pays well and keeps quiet when it comes to the cops. But can you outsmart the authorities in a rusted-out Sandy Shores special?

Once a car is stolen, the player delivers it to **Billy Joe**, who rewards them with a random payout. Afterward, **Billy Jim** steps in to dismantle the vehicle right in front of any curious bystanders—or the police, if they arrive on scene. The script ensures that players can't take on multiple jobs at once and offers immersive animations and interactions. Notably, **Billy Joe** refuses to talk to on-duty police officers.

### Key Features:
- **Customizable Config** for a tailored experience
- **7 pre-included vehicles** randomly chosen for theft
- **40 random car pickup locations** around Sandy Shores
- Police get notified when players start to hotwire a vehicle
- Adjustable **hotwire time** (min/max length)
- Option to require police to be on duty for the job to be available
